# STOCHOS
Maintenance scheduling optimization for offshore wind farms under uncertainty

This repo contains the code used for the analysis done in the paper "*STOCHOS: Stochastic Opportunistic Maintenance Scheduling For Offshore Wind Farms*" This is a work in progress, so changes and additional documentations are underway.

To view preliminary results, after cloning this repo, you can use the <code>IISE_paper_figures.ipynb</code> notebook that is provided, but first the optimization solutions (stored as .json files) must be downloaded from the shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kn-hTBSbv5N4VF6W8eGThGqy4OirypO5?usp=sharing).
